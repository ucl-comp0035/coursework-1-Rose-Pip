# Coursework 2

Most students will use the same repository for coursework 2. You may use this file to present the results of that
coursework if you wish. Alternatively you can use video or audio to provide the explanations instead of writing them.
## Definition of the business need
### Problem definition
It is predicted that the population of Great London area will increase to up to 3 million people. Thus, an effective and efficient urban environmental protection project will is vital to help the city stay healthy and liveable as the population becomes larger.

London City Hall is the headquarters of the Greater London Authority (GLA), which comprises the Mayor of London and the London Assembly [1]. This authority has an ongoing **Urban Greening** project to improve the environment in the Great London area. One of the actions taken in this project is **tree planting** in the Great London area. **Tree planting** helps to improve the poor air quality and soil quality in the urban areas via removing and storing harmful chemicals (such as CO2, SO2, Lead)[3]. The 'Urban Greening' project also aims to Mitigating the impact of global warming on the weather in London and to increase the sustainability of the local economy with a decrease (or even elimination) in CO2 footprint[2]. 

The London City Hall would like to examine the effectiveness of the **tree planting** action under the **Urban Greening** project, in which way they can seek for improvements in their tree planting strategies in the future (such as which borough needs more regreening, and which tree species is the most suitable options, etc). However, it is financially impossible and extremely inefficient for the London City Hall to send employees to manually process the urban tree datasets to estimate the real-time distribution of trees, growth rate of quantity of trees and other characteristics of trees in all London boroughs. Therefore, it is necessary to automate the data analysis and visualisation process to generate informative results, which enables the London City Hall to establish strategic moves in the future regarding the current stage of the **tree planting** action. All data and visuals will be open to the UK citizens according to the transparency policies. 

### Target audience
London City Hall - Use the web app to examine the effectiveness of their tree planting action, and to seek for improvements in their greening strategies constantly. Citizens are alse encouraged to use the web app. 
**Sample Persona**

## Requirements definition and analysis
**The requirements section is based on the business need section, i.e. the problem definiton and the targeted audience.**
Based on the problem definition and target audience, a context diagram is generated to briefly describe the interaction between the relevant entities with the system of the web app.

### Requirements identification methods
The requirements identification method applied is to identify requirements from users' stories based on brainstorming. In real-life application, surveys and interviews will be combined to generate users' wants and needs (surveys and interviews will take place with ethics approval in London City Hall). However, since no ethics approval is given in this case, no survey or interview is done. All users' stories will solely based on brainstorming and referring to similar web apps. 
### Requirement specification method
The framework chosen for this web app is Scrum to provide an agile application designing process. 
Therefore the **user story methodology** is implied for requirement specification, as it is highly adaptable in agile software development. It demonstrates the types of users and their wants and needs, from which the accpetance criteria are set for the web app design. 
The user story list is constantly updated based on the changes of users' needs and the realisticity of users' needs. A user story list is documented and provided below. 
### Prioritisation method
**MosCoW Method** is a highly suitable prioritisation method for this web app. MosCoW method is a common tool to categorise requirements so that the stakeholders of the web app can come to a common agreement on the most urgent and important requirements.
It is a 4-step process:
**Must have**: The web-app features that must be included, else the web app is meaningless. For instance, Youtube must be able to play videos on the web page. 
**Should have**: The Web-app features that are important but not a must-have. These features differ from the 'Must have' in a way that they can be added in a later released version without impacting the current version. 
**Could have**: The 'could-have' features are the ones that are good to have for th web app, but not necessary nor urgent. For instance, Deliveroo app can add a voice message function to the deilverer chat box so that the customer can choose to leave a quick easy voice message rather than typing. However, this feature is not necessary nor urgent.
**Will not have**: These are the features that will not be added to the web app in the current status to prevent **scope creep** (running out of time and resources because of the forever changing requirements). They might be prioritised in the future released versions, depending on the time and resources given in the future. 
### Documented and prioritised requirements
#### User story table (specified requirements)

#### Prioritised requirements 
**Note that in this coursework, the design of the web app mainly focuses on the Must-have and Should-have requirements.**

## Design
### Structure and flow of the interface
The class diagram of this web app is: 


### Relational database design

### Application structure


## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests
The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results
Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration (optional)
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.
